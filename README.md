# Weather Application

# Project Description

This project is a weather application where users can input the name of any city to obtain information about its weather, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Team Members

- Mulugeta Tesfatsion

## Architecture and Technologies

The application is built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- node.js
- express.js
- mongodb
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Weather API

## Development

I initially proposed to create a website that fetches weather data from an API. I found a tutorial on YouTube and began my development journey. The project took me 5 days to complete. The project folder includes subfolders for CSS styles, images, and the API.

## Conclusion

This project was a valuable experience for me, allowing me to learn and apply various technologies. It marked the beginning of my journey into software engineering, and I plan to continue exploring and developing my skills.
